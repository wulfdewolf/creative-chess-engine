# Adding creativity to a heuristics-based chess engine
A creative chess engine that consists of an extension to Stockfish to combine the Stockfish optimality scores with newly defined creativity scores. The optimal combination of scores was learned through self-play. This project was made for the _Computational Creativity_ course in my first master year computer science at VUB.

The used stockfish version can be found [here](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).
The chess database used by the creativity grading framework can be found [here](https://www.chessdb.cn/cloudbookc_api_en.html).
